   The function performs a binary search algorithm to efficiently locate the target in the sorted array. It returns the index of the target if it's found, or the index where it would be inserted if it's not found.
   
   The binary search algorithm divides the search interval in half at each step, reducing the search space by half each time until the target is found or the search space is empty. This makes it a very efficient way to search for a target in a sorted
